This assignment was an introduction to deep learning tools for computer vision. Here, we design and train deep convolutional networks for object recognition ([cifar-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)) using [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org).

This project was orignially run on Google Colab using a GPU hardware accelerator runtime. Implementaion at `<span>CSE352_21S_A4.ipynb</span>`.
